# Automated Testing Project for Evomag.ro Website :computer:
Welcome to the documentation for the automated testing project designed for the **EvoMag.ro website.** This project leverages **Cypress, BDD (Behavior-driven development) with Cucumber.js, and the POM (Page Object Model) framework** to implement a robust suite of tests, ensuring the functionality and reliability.

# Introduction :notebook:
 
This project aims to implement automated tests for the evomag website using Cypress and the combination of BDD (Behavior-driven development) and POM (Page Object Model) frameworks. 


Tools and Versions
- Cypress version: [![Cypress](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cypress?color=33ff99&label=cypress&logo=cypress&logoColor=33ff99&style=for-the-badge)](https://www.cypress.io)
- Editor code:**Visual Studio Code (latest version)**
- imports 
     - [badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor](https://github.com/badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor)
     - [multiple-cucumber-html-reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multiple-cucumber-html-reporter)
   


**EvoMag.ro** is one of the largest online stores in Romania, specializing in selling a wide range of electronic products, appliances, IT&C, as well as products for home and garden.

**Behavior-driven development (BDD)** is an Agile software development methodology in which an application is documented and designed around the behavior a user expects to experience when interacting with it. By encouraging developers to focus only on the requested behaviors of an app or program, BDD helps to avoid bloat, excessive code, unnecessary features or lack of focus. This methodology combines, augments and refines the practices used in test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance testing.

[**Cucumber**](https://cucumber.io/) is a testing framework that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). It allows you to write test cases in a human-readable format using the Gherkin syntax, which is easily understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Designing a Page Object** in test automation involves creating a representation of a web page or component in your application, encapsulating its elements and behaviors.

# Project structure 

The project structure for the automated testing project of EvoMag.ro website is organized as follows:



### Project Structure Overview:

- **cypress/**: This directory contains all the Cypress-specific files and folders.
  - **CucumberReports**: Directory for storing HTML reports generated by Cucumber.
  - **fixtures/**: Contains static data used by tests, such as JSON files.
  - **integration/**: Contains test files written in Cucumber's Gherkin syntax, such as `Wishlist.feature`.
  - **plugins/**: Cypress plugins configuration, if any.
  - **support/**: Contains test configuration and utility functions, including step definitions for Cucumber tests.
  - **pageObjects/**: Contains Page Object Model (POM) classes, each representing a page or component of the EvoMag.ro website. For example, `WishlistPage.js` represents the login page.
  - **Locators** :This directory may contain files or modules that define the locators (unique identifiers) of UI elements on the page. These are used within the Page Object Model (POM) classes 
    to locate and interact with the respective elements.
- **node_modules/**: This directory contains all the Node.js modules installed via npm, including Cypress and any other dependencies.
- **cypress.json**: Cypress configuration file, which may include settings such as base URL, viewport size, etc.
- **package.json**: Node.js dependencies and scripts for managing the project.
- **README.md**: Project documentation, including an overview, setup instructions, and other relevant information.
- **Cucumber-html-reports.js**: JavaScript file responsible for generating HTML reports from Cucumber JSON output.

This project structure is designed to promote modularity, maintainability, and scalability of the automated testing suite for the EvoMag.ro website. The use of the Page Object Model (POM) facilitates the abstraction of UI elements and interactions, while the integration with Cucumber enables Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and enhances collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

# Test scenario

### Test Scenario for wishlist feature from  wishlist.feature file 

```gherkin
  Feature: Wishlist feature

  Background: Logged in to account 
    Given I am logged in on the page 

  @smoke_wishlist_add-item
  Scenario: Add Item to Wishlist
    When I select a product from page 
    And I click on the add Wishlist button
    And I click on save modify 
    Then The item should be added to my Wishlist
 
  @regression_wishlist_remove-item
  Scenario: Remove item from the wishlist
    When I click on my wishlist
    And I click on edit wishlist
    And I attempt to remove an item
    And I click save button
    Then the item should be removed from the wishlist
  
  @regression_wishlist_add-to-cart
  Scenario: Add all the item from wishlist to my cart
    When I click on my wishlist
    And I click wishlist from my list
    And Press adauga in cos button
    Then all the items should be visible in cart
```

### Test Scenario for Search feature from  Search.feature file 

```gherkin
Feature:Search Functionality

     Background: Logged in to account 
     Given I am logged in on the page 

 Scenario Outline: Search multiple products
    When I introduce "<ValidProduct>" in the search bar
    And I click the search button
    Then I should see search results for "<ValidProduct>"

    Examples:
      | ValidProduct    |
      | iPhone         |
      | MacBook        |
      | SmartWatch   |

  Scenario Outline: Search price range product
  When I enter "<product>" in the search bar
  And I click the search button
  And I click "<keyword>" price filter
  Then I should see the prices for items in "<keyword>" order

Examples:
  | product       | keyword           |
  | SmartWatch    | Pret crescator     |
  | Phone         | Pret descrescator  |
```
# Getting Started :pushpin:

To get started with running the automated tests for the EvoMag.ro website, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- Git installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdrianPricopie/ProjectTesting-With-Cypress-BDD-Page-object-model-frameworks.git
```
2.Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ProjectTesting-With-Cypress-BDD-Page-object-model-frameworks
```
3.Install project dependencies using npm:
```bash
npm install
```
4.Running the tests
```bash
npm test
```
5.Running the tests with html reports
```bash
node cucumber-html-report.js
```
After the test execution is completed, Cypress generates detailed test reports with information about passed and failed tests, along with screenshots and error messages.
You can access these reports by navigating to the cypress/reports directory and opening the HTML files in your browser
